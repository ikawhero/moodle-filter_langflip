Langflip filter for Moodle
===============================================================================

Reverses the text and turns the characters upside down.

The filter uses unicode characters as representation of upside down latin
alphabet characters.

I only wrote this filter as a fun project so if you find any bugs, please let
me know and I'll do my best to fix them when I get some time. Or even better,
if you can fix them then please feel free to send me a patch or a pull request
via github.


Known Bugs:
It sometimes clashes with other filters especially the Tex and Algebra notation
if it's lower down the order.


Installation:
    * see http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_contributed_modules_or_plugins

Unzip, rename the folder as langflip and place it in the /filter/ folder of
your moodle installation.
